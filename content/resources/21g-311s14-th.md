description: "Ni Putes Ni Soumises (NPNS), \"Neither Whores nor Submissives,\" is\
  \ a French feminist movement set up in response to acts of violence against women,\
  \ particularly in Islamic neighborhoods. In 2003, NPNS staged a march through more\
  \ that 20 cities of France. Their message was incorporated into the official Bastille\
  \ Day celebrations later that year in Paris, when 14 posters of modern woman of\
  \ different ethnicities dressed as Marianne were displayed on the columns of the\
  \ Palais Bourbon, the home of the Assembl\xE9e nationale. Thumbnail image of Safia\
  \ as a modern Marianne. Source: Les symboles et les valeurs del la R\xE9publique.\
